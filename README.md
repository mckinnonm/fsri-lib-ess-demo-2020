# LIB_ESS_Demo_DiB

This repository contains the data and supporting files from walk-in containerized lithium-ion battery energy storage system experiments in which a unit rack was forced to thermal runaway and the resulting thermal energy and chemicals released were quantified with a wide array of sensors. The tests were conducted in accordance with the 2019 version of the UL 9540A Standard Test Method.

This repository contains the data and supporting files from walk-in containerized lithium-ion battery energy storage system experiments in which a unit rack was forced to thermal runaway and the resulting thermal chemials releases were quantified with a wide array of sensors. The tests were conducted in accordance with the 2019 version of the UL 9540A Standard Test Method.


The full report from the experimental series is available here: [UL 9540A Installation Level Tests with Outdoor Lithium-ion Energy Storage System Mockups](http://dx.doi.org/10.54206/102376/JEMY9731).

## 01_Data
The data directory is broken into three subdirectories; one for each of the experiments. More information on the structure of the included files and the corresponding experiments can be found here: [Data Details](01_Data/README.md) 

## 02_Info
The info directory contains notes and observations from the experiments. Dimensioned, instrumented floor plans and schematics are also provided in the info directory.
